# UNTITLED
A Discord bot primarily for use in the UNTITLED Discord server.

## Figuring out what I am doing
After running into issues and not knowing how to solve them, I realise that I need to learn how to use Git/Github together with VSC, so I'm  going watch a bunch of tutorials for Git and Github before continuing on with the project. Later, I will take a look at environments (venv things?) and packages that I need for the project and make sure that it works correctly.

This is a test.
