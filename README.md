## Figuring out what I am doing
After running into issues and not knowing how to solve them, I realise that I need to learn how to use Git/Github together with VSC, so I'm  going watch a bunch of tutorials for Git and Github before continuing on with the project. Later, I will take a look at environments (venv things?) and packages that I need for the project and make sure that it works correctly.

On second thought, I might first want to try to just write a python script capable of reading the contents of a file, extracting the correct data, and making the calculations that I want it to.

### Text File Reader and Wordle Score Calculator
I have begun creating a Wordle Score Calculator, reading from a file. It currently reads the whole file and appends each line to a list variable. Now I need to learn to extract the correct data and make the calculations.
